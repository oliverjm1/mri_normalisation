# Does Normalisation Affect Generalisability?

## A comparison of methods for MRI segmentation

3D U-Nets were trained on the IWOAI 2019 dataset with different normalisation methods using the nnU-Net framework.
These models were then tested on both internal and external (SKM-TEA) data to investigate whether some methods offer increased generalisability to domain shift.
